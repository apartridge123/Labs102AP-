1.  What happens if I type step 3 as another step 1? if you type step 3 as another step 1 Rstudio will not register the numbers as a list. 

*   What does this star at the beginning do? The star will create a neatly organized bullet point list. 
*   Visually, it's similar to the numbered list.

1.  What happens if we nest a list? If you nest the list it becomes more neat and organized opposed to the disorganized jumble of the prior list.
    1.  Type four spaces, then type the number
    2.  Did this do what you expected? 
2.  What if we contine the numbers this way?
    *   What happens if we indent using stars?
    *   Let's add another one for good measure.
